    <h1>Fred Johnson</h1>

    <p>In the winter of 2022, I took a trip to Montreal, and it was absolutely freezing. I had a blast wandering around Old Montreal, checking out the cool old buildings and warming up with hot chocolate in cosy cafés. The food was amazing too – I tried poutine for the first time and loved it, and the nightlife was a lot of fun.</p>

    <h2>Favourite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>McDonald's is my favourite restaurant because it's quick, convenient, and consistently delicious. Plus, their fries and Big Macs are simply unbeatable!</p>

    <p>I love munching on McDonald's French fries, especially when they're hot and crispy. Dipping them in ketchup just makes them even more irresistible!</p>
